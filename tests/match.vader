  match event with\<CR>
  | Move(Left) -> Action.move("left")\<CR>
  | Fire -> Action.fire

Expect:
  match event with

  | Fire -> Action.fire

Do (Action on separate line):
  i
  match event with\<CR>
  | Move(Left) ->\<CR>
  Action.move("left")\<CR>
  | Fire ->\<CR>
  Action.fire

Expect:
  match event with
  | Move(Left) ->
    Action.move("left")
  | Fire ->
    Action.fire

Do (Action on separate line with predicates):
  i
  match event with\<CR>
  | Move(Left)\<CR>
  when something = true ->\<CR>
  Action.move("left")\<CR>
  | Fire\<CR>
  when something = true ->\<CR>
  Action.fire

Expect:
  match event with
